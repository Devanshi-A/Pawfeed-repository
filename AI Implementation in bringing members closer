We even implemented AI to automatically add new members to their local groups for better communication and support so that joined activities between pet parents can take place. 
Like shared pet walks, pet festival vists, park dates, etc.
Used backend code, Automations and AI through Wix to achieve this.
But joining the group is ultimately the member's personal wish.
So instead of directly adding members to their respectivev local communities,
We have programmed it such to send an email to the member inviting them to join.
