Through this project, we aimed to design a platform to connect pet parents since they currently lack a dedicated, unified space to interact
and support one another.
While social media existed like Facebook communities, Reddit threads, Whatsapp Channels etc, it is fragmented and often
generalized. 
Nor do they provide basic facility reviews and connections every pet owner requires. 
They were just social messaging threads that did not serve it's purpose right.
So when asked to build a functional prototype of a pet-owner community that makes
the pet ownership experience more connected, we went over and above trying to brainstorm of all pet owners might need and to provide easy access to them.
Our little "digital town square" for pet parents was what we toiled over.
We names it "Pawfeed' since most of us liked how short and simplistic symbolism it held.
"Paw" connects to pets, and "Feed" connects to the blog and discssion forums that were created to solve the problem.
